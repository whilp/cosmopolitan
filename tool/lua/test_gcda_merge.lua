-- Regression test for the __gcov_write lock (libc/intrin/gcov.c):
-- when N processes race to rewrite the same instrumented object's
-- shared .gcda at exit, the fix's whole-file F_SETLKW lock must make
-- the read-merge-write one critical section, so every process's run
-- is counted and none is dropped.
--
-- This is the exact race make -j puts every instrumented object
-- through: many test processes share one lua.dbg build, and every one
-- of them writes the same .gcda per object at exit. Here N children,
-- each an execve() of this test's own lua.dbg (arg[-1]), stand in for
-- that: forked together, they exit close enough in time to collide on
-- the lock if it did not exist.
--
-- The shared object is tool/net/lfuncs.c as linked into the lua
-- binary: tool/lua/lfuncs3.c #includes it (see tool/lua/BUILD.mk), so
-- gcc's -dumpbase names its .gcda after that translation unit, not
-- lfuncs.c's own directory -- tool/net/lfuncs.o is a separate object
-- for other binaries and is never part of this process at all.
--
-- Run this after gcda.clean like every other cov test, and run it the
-- way the item names -- `make MODE=cov o/cov/tool/lua/test`, with no
-- -j -- so no sibling test process touches this same .gcda while this
-- one runs; the only writers during this test's window are this
-- process itself (if it was not the first cov test to touch lfuncs.c
-- code) and the N children each iteration forks below. That is what
-- makes an exact before/after delta of N meaningful.
--
-- N children racing once is not reliable enough on its own: two or
-- more of the N read-merge-write windows sometimes don't collide even
-- with the lock missing, so a single N=8 trial misses a real lock
-- regression on a non-trivial fraction of runs. This runs the
-- fork-and-race body ITERATIONS times in the same process instead of
-- widening N further, checking each iteration's own exact delta
-- against the reading immediately before it and failing on the first
-- iteration that is wrong -- a real regression only needs one of the
-- ITERATIONS trials to collide, which drives the miss rate down
-- multiplicatively without needing a much larger single-shot N.
