--- Options controlling how `EncodeJson` and `EncodeLua` serialize a value.
---@class cosmo.EncoderOptions
---@field useoutput boolean? defaults to `false`. Encodes the result directly to the output buffer and returns `nil` value. This option is ignored if used outside of request handling code.
---@field sorted boolean? defaults to `true`. Lua uses hash tables so the order of object keys is lost in a Lua table. So, by default, we use strcmp to impose a deterministic output order. If you don't care about ordering then setting sorted=false should yield a performance boost in serialization.
---@field pretty boolean? defaults to `false`. Setting this option to true will cause tables with more than one entry to be formatted across multiple lines for readability.
---@field indent string? defaults to " ". This option controls the indentation of pretty formatting. This field is ignored if pretty isn't true.
---@field maxdepth integer? defaults to 64. This option controls the maximum amount of recursion the serializer is allowed to perform. The max is 32767. You might not be able to set it that high if there isn't enough C stack memory. Your serializer checks for this and will return an error rather than crashing.
---@field nan cosmo.JsonNanMode? `EncodeJson` only: encode NaN and Infinity as `null` (the v8 behavior) instead of failing with `nil, error`.
---@field sparsenull boolean? `EncodeJson` only: encode array holes as `null` instead of failing the encode with `nil, error`. With it, an array containing JSON `null` round-trips losslessly with `DecodeJson`'s default nil mapping. Bounded: an array whose largest index exceeds 8x its element count (beyond a 64-element floor) still fails with `nil, error`, so one stray huge index cannot make the encode effectively unbounded.
---@field literal boolean? `EncodeLua` only: fail with `nil, reason` on any value outside the literal-data domain, instead of spelling it as something a literal reader turns down. Refused with it: a non-string or reserved-word table key, byte 27 in a key or string, `math.mininteger`, NaN and the infinities, a function, thread, userdata or light userdata, a cyclic table, and nesting past `maxdepth` — every one of which is otherwise written as arithmetic, a global read, an escape, or a `"kind@pointer"` placeholder. The reason is a non-empty string whose exact wording is unspecified. Without it the encode is byte-identical to what it has always produced.

--- Options for `DecodeJson`, controlling how JSON `null` maps into Lua.
---@class cosmo.DecoderOptions
---@field nullval JsonValue? a value to stand in for JSON `null` (dkjson-style), so nulls survive the decode as a distinguishable value. `cosmo.null` re-encodes as `null`, making null round-trips lossless. When absent, `null` decodes to nil: null-valued object keys vanish and arrays containing null decode with holes.

--- Options for `Deflate`: how hard to compress, and how to frame the result.
---@class cosmo.DeflateOptions
---@field level integer? compression level `-1`..`9`; defaults to `-1`, the zlib default (currently 6). `0` stores without compressing; higher levels are slower but compress better.
---@field format cosmo.CompressFormat? framing of the compressed stream; defaults to `"raw"` (headerless DEFLATE, as used inside ZIP files).

--- Options for `Inflate`: how the input is framed, and the cap on how much
--- it may decompress to.
---@class cosmo.InflateOptions
---@field maxsize integer? cap on the decompressed size in bytes; defaults to 64 MiB. Decompression streams into a growing buffer and fails with `nil, error` once the cap is exceeded, so no attacker-controlled length is ever trusted as an allocation size.
---@field format cosmo.UncompressFormat? framing of the compressed stream; defaults to `"raw"`. `"auto"` detects zlib or gzip framing from the stream header (but cannot detect `"raw"`).

--- Options for `Fetch`: the request to send, and how redirects, proxying,
--- and connection reuse are handled.
---@class cosmo.FetchOptions
---@field headers table<string,string>? request headers to send.
---@field method string? HTTP method, e.g. `"GET"` (default) or `"POST"`.
---@field body string? request payload.
---@field maxredirects integer? maximum number of redirects to follow.
---@field followredirect boolean? whether to follow redirects. Defaults to `true`.
---@field allowprivate boolean? allow requests to private, loopback, and other non-public network addresses (disables the SSRF guard). Applies to every hop of a redirect chain. Defaults to `false`.
---@field keepalive boolean? whether to keep the connection alive.
---@field proxy string? proxy URL to route the request through.
---@field maxresponse integer? limit on response (or per-read buffer) size.
---@field timeout number? request timeout in seconds. `0` or absent keeps the 60-second default; there is no "infinite" option.

-- MODULES

--- For example, you could put the following in your `/.init.lua` file:
---
---     lsqlite3 = require "lsqlite3"
---     db = lsqlite3.open_memory()
---     db:exec[[
---       CREATE TABLE test (
---         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
---         content TEXT
---       );
---       INSERT INTO test (content) VALUES ('Hello World');
---       INSERT INTO test (content) VALUES ('Hello Lua');
---       INSERT INTO test (content) VALUES ('Hello Sqlite3');
---     ]]
---
--- Then, your Lua server pages or OnHttpRequest handler may perform SQL
--- queries by accessing the db global. The performance is good too, at about
--- 400k qps.
---
---     for row in db:nrows("SELECT * FROM test") do
---         Write(row.id.." "..row.content.."<br>")
---     end

    -- Error Codes

    --- The `lsqlite3.OK` result code means that the operation was successful
    --- and that there were no errors. Most other result codes indicate an
    --- error.
    OK = 0,
    --- The `lsqlite3.ERROR` result code is a generic error code that is used
    --- when no other more specific error code is available.
    ERROR = 1,
    --- The `lsqlite3.INTERNAL` result code indicates an internal malfunction.
    --- In a working version of SQLite, an application should never see this
    --- result code. If application does encounter this result code, it shows
    --- that there is a bug in the database engine.
    ---
    --- SQLite does not currently generate this result code. However,
    --- application-defined SQL functions or virtual tables, or VFSes, or other
    --- extensions might cause this result code to be returned.
    INTERNAL = 2,
    --- The `lsqlite3.PERM` result code indicates that the requested access mode
    --- for a newly created database could not be provided.
    PERM = 3,
    --- The `lsqlite3.ABORT` result code indicates that an operation was aborted
    --- prior to completion, usually be application request. See also:
    --- `lsqlite3.INTERRUPT`.
    ---
    --- If the callback function to `exec()` returns non-zero, then `exec()`
    --- will return `lsqlite3.ABORT`.
    ---
    --- If a ROLLBACK operation occurs on the same database connection as a
    --- pending read or write, then the pending read or write may fail with an
    --- `lsqlite3.ABORT` error.
    ABORT = 4,
    --- The lsqlite3.BUSY result code indicates that the database file could not
    --- be written (or in some cases read) because of concurrent activity by
    --- some other database connection, usually a database connection in a
    --- separate process.
    ---
    --- For example, if process A is in the middle of a large write transaction
    --- and at the same time process B attempts to start a new write
    --- transaction, process B will get back an `lsqlite3.BUSY` result because
    --- SQLite only supports one writer at a time. Process B will need to wait
    --- for process A to finish its transaction before starting a new
    --- transaction. The `db:busy_timeout()` and `db:busy_handler()` interfaces
    --- are available to process B to help it deal with `lsqlite3.BUSY` errors.
    ---
    --- An `lsqlite3.BUSY` error can occur at any point in a transaction: when
    --- the transaction is first started, during any write or update operations,
    --- or when the transaction commits. To avoid encountering `lsqlite3.BUSY`
    --- errors in the middle of a transaction, the application can use
    --- `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` instead of just `BEGIN` to start a transaction. The
    --- `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` command might itself return `lsqlite3.BUSY`, but if it
    --- succeeds, then SQLite guarantees that no subsequent operations on the same database through the next COMMIT will return `lsqlite3.BUSY`.
    ---
    --- The `lsqlite3.BUSY` result code differs from `lsqlite3.LOCKED` in that
    --- `lsqlite3.BUSY` indicates a conflict with a separate database
    --- connection, probably in a separate process, whereas `lsqlite3.LOCKED`
    --- indicates a conflict within the same database connection (or sometimes
    --- a database connection with a shared cache).
    BUSY = 5,
    --- The `lsqlite3.LOCKED` result code indicates that a write operation could
    --- not continue because of a conflict within the same database connection
    --- or a conflict with a different database connection that uses a shared
    --- cache.
    ---
    --- For example, a DROP TABLE statement cannot be run while another thread
    --- is reading from that table on the same database connection because
    --- dropping the table would delete the table out from under the concurrent
    --- reader.
    ---
    --- The `lsqlite3.LOCKED` result code differs from `lsqlite3.BUSY` in that
    --- `lsqlite3.LOCKED` indicates a conflict on the same database connection

    --- indicates a conflict with a different database connection, probably in
    --- a different process.
    LOCKED = 6,
    --- The `lsqlite3.NOMEM` result code indicates that SQLite was unable to
    --- allocate all the memory it needed to complete the operation. In other

    --- failed in a case where the memory being allocated was required in order
    --- to continue the operation.

    --- The `lsqlite3.IOERR` result code says that the operation could not
    --- finish because the operating system reported an I/O error.

    --- than an `lsqlite3.IOERR` error.

    --- interface to indicate that the file control opcode passed as the third
    --- argument was not recognized by the underlying VFS.
    ---
    --- `lsqlite3.NOTFOUND` can also be returned by the xSetSystemCall() method
    --- of an sqlite3_vfs object.
    ---
    --- `lsqlite3.NOTFOUND` an be returned by sqlite3_vtab_rhs_value() to
    --- indicate that the right-hand operand of a constraint is not available
    --- to the xBestIndex method that made the call.
    ---
    --- The `lsqlite3.NOTFOUND` result code is also used internally by the
    --- SQLite implementation, but those internal uses are not exposed to the
    --- application.
    NOTFOUND = 12,
    --- The `lsqlite3.FULL` result code indicates that a write could not
    --- complete because the disk is full. Note that this error can occur when
    --- trying to write information into the main database file, or it can also
    --- occur when writing into temporary disk files.
    ---
    --- Sometimes applications encounter this error even though there is an
    --- abundance of primary disk space because the error occurs when writing
    --- into temporary disk files on a system where temporary files are stored
    --- on a separate partition with much less space that the primary disk.

    --- this error can result.
    ---
    --- The statement is automatically re-prepared if the schema changes, up to

    --- 1,000,000,000 bytes. This maximum length can be changed at compile-time
    --- using the `SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH` compile-time option. The `lsqlite3.TOOBIG`
    --- error results when SQLite encounters a string or BLOB that exceeds the
    --- compile-time limit.
    ---
    --- The `lsqlite3.TOOBIG` error code can also result when an oversized SQL
    --- statement is passed into one of the `db:prepare()` interface. The

    --- the extended error code.
    ---
    --- The `lsqlite3.CONSTRAINT` code can also be used as the return value from

--- One recognized option: how it was spelled, and its argument when it

---@class getopt.Option

---@field arg string? its argument, or nil when the option takes none

--- The outcome of one `getopt.parse`: what was recognized, what was

---@class getopt.Result
--- The outcome of a single `getopt.parse` call.
---@field opts getopt.Option[] Recognized options, in the order encountered
---@field args string[] Non-option (positional) arguments
---@field unknown string[] Unrecognized options, each including its dashes
---@field missing string[] Options that required an argument but got none

--- Parse a command-line argument vector in one shot.
---
--- The optstring uses standard getopt format:
--- - A letter means that option takes no argument
--- - A letter followed by : means it requires an argument
--- - A letter followed by :: means it takes an optional argument
---
--- The longopts table contains entries like {"name", "has_arg", "short"}:
--- - name: the long option name (e.g., "help" for --help)
--- - has_arg: "none", "required", or "optional"
--- - short: the equivalent short option character (e.g., "h"), or nil
---
--- The result separates four outcomes. `opts` lists the recognized options in
--- order, each as a {opt, arg} pair. `args` holds the leftover positional
--- arguments. `unknown` holds unrecognized options (always spelled with their
--- dashes, e.g. "-x" or "--nope"). `missing` holds the options that required an
--- argument but were given none (named without dashes, e.g. "o"); this is kept
--- distinct from `unknown` via getopt's leading-`:` protocol.
---
--- Example - Basic usage:
---
---     local r = getopt.parse(arg, "hvo:", {
---       {"help",    "none",     "h"},
---       {"verbose", "none",     "v"},
---       {"output",  "required", "o"},
---     })
---     for _, o in ipairs(r.opts) do
---       if o.opt == "h" then
---         print("Usage: ...")
---       elseif o.opt == "v" then
---         verbose = true
---       elseif o.opt == "o" then
---         output = o.arg
---       end
---     end
---     -- r.args     -- non-option arguments
---     -- r.unknown  -- unrecognized options, with dashes
---     -- r.missing  -- options missing a required argument
---
--- Example - Handling repeated options:
---
---     local r = getopt.parse(arg, "e:")
---     local excludes = {}
---     for _, o in ipairs(r.opts) do
---       if o.opt == "e" then
---         table.insert(excludes, o.arg)
---       end
---     end
---     -- Now excludes contains all -e values: {"foo", "bar", "spam"}
---
--- A malformed call -- `args` not a table, `optstring` not a string,
--- `longopts` not nil/a table, an `args`/`longopts` table over its size
--- limit, or a malformed `longopts` entry -- raises rather than returning
--- an error, since none of those is a getopt_long() runtime outcome: no
--- shape a correct caller passes can reach it.
---
---@param args string[] Command-line arguments (typically `arg`)
---@param optstring string Short options string (e.g., "hvo:")
---@param longopts? table[] Long option definitions: {{name, has_arg, short}, ...}
---@return getopt.Result result
function getopt.parse(args, optstring, longopts) end

--- The path module may be used to manipulate unix paths.
---
--- Note that we use unix paths on Windows. For example, if you have a
--- path like `C:\foo\bar` then it should be `/c/foo/bar` with redbean.
--- It should also be noted the unix module is more permissive when
--- using Windows paths, where translation to win32 is very light.

--- This module implements a password hashing algorithm based on blake2b that won
--- the Password Hashing Competition.
---
--- It can be used to securely store user passwords in your SQLite database, in a
--- way that destroys the password, but can be verified by regenerating the hash
--- again the next time the user logs in. Destroying the password is important,
--- since if your database is compromised, the bad guys won't be able to use
--- rainbow tables to recover the plain text of the passwords.
---
--- Argon2 achieves this security by being expensive to compute. Care should be
--- taken in choosing parameters, since an HTTP endpoint that uses Argon2 can just
--- as easily become a denial of service vector. For example, you may want to
--- consider throttling your login endpoint.
argon2 = {}

--- Argon2 variant names accepted by `argon2.hash_encoded` (validated
--- by the strcmp chain in `tool/net/largon2.c`).
---@alias argon2.Variant "argon2id"|"argon2i"|"argon2d"

--- Cost parameters and variant for password hashing.
---@class argon2.Config
---@field m_cost integer? the memory hardness in kibibytes, which defaults to 4096 (4 mibibytes). It's recommended that this be tuned upwards.
---@field t_cost integer? the number of iterations, which defaults to `3`.

---@field hash_len integer? the number of desired bytes in hash output, which defaults to 32.
---@field variant argon2.Variant? the Argon2 variant: `"argon2id"` blend of other two methods [default], `"argon2i"` maximize resistance to side-channel attacks, or `"argon2d"` maximize resistance to gpu cracking attacks

--- Hashes password.
---
--- This is consistent with the README of the reference implementation:

---         hash_len = 24,

---
---
--- `salt` is a nonce value used to hash the string. It is optional: when it is

--- ### ZIP
---
--- The zip module provides functionality for creating and reading ZIP archives.
--- This module is available as `require("cosmo.zip")`.
---
--- Example - Creating a ZIP archive:
---
---     local zip = require("cosmo.zip")
---     local archive = assert(zip.open("output.zip", "w"))
---     archive:add("hello.txt", "Hello, World!")
---     archive:add("data/config.json", '{"key": "value"}')
---     archive:close()
---
--- Example - Reading a ZIP archive:
---
---     local zip = require("cosmo.zip")
---     local archive = assert(zip.open("input.zip", "r"))
---     local files = archive:list()

---       print(entry.name, entry.size, #content)
---     end
---     archive:close()
---
--- Example - Reading from in-memory data:
---
---     local zip = require("cosmo.zip")
---     local archive = assert(zip.from(Slurp("input.zip")))
---     print(archive:read("hello.txt"))
---     archive:close()
---

---@return boolean? success `true` on success
---@return string? error Error message on failure
function zip.Appender:remove(name) end

--- Closes the ZIP archive and writes the updated central directory.
--- Close is where the pending entries actually land on disk: every

--- ### COVERAGE
---
--- The cov module is a line-hit coverage collector: a C line hook that
--- counts executed (chunk source, line) pairs, the same accounting a
--- Lua `debug.sethook` collector performs at a small fraction of the
--- per-line cost. This module is available as `require("cosmo.cov")`.
---
--- Counts are process-global and shared by every armed thread. Hooks
--- are per-coroutine, but new threads inherit a C hook from their
--- creator, so a coroutine created while collection runs counts
--- automatically; `arm` opts in one created before `start`.
---
---     local cov = require("cosmo.cov")
---     cov.start()
---     do_work()
---     cov.stop()
---     for src, lines in pairs(cov.snapshot()) do
---       for line, hits in pairs(lines) do
---         print(src, line, hits)
---       end
---     end
---
cov = {}

--- Arms an instruction budget on the calling thread's collection: the
--- hook raises `"cosmo.cov: instruction budget exceeded"` once `n` VM
--- instructions have executed. Re-arms the thread, which restarts Lua's
--- internal instruction counter, so each call gives a fresh budget
--- rather than continuing a previous one; the budget is one-shot and
--- does not fire again once raised. Returns `false`, changing nothing,
--- when the calling thread's debug hook is not this collector's — the
--- caller then falls back to its own `debug.sethook` budget instead.
---@param n integer? VM instructions until the hook raises; nil or 0 clears the budget
---@return boolean armed `false` when the calling thread's hook is not the collector's
function cov.budget(n) end

--- Arms line-hit collection on the calling thread. Counting starts (or
--- resumes) immediately; counts accumulate into process-global state
--- shared with every other armed thread. Installs a Lua debug hook, so
--- it replaces any hook already set on the thread (and a later
--- `debug.sethook` replaces this one, ending collection there).
function cov.start() end

--- Disarms collection on the calling thread. A hook installed by
--- something other than this collector is left alone. Collected counts
--- are kept; use `reset` to discard them.
function cov.stop() end

--- Reports whether the calling thread's debug hook is this collector's
--- line hook.
---@return boolean running `true` when collection is armed on this thread
---@nodiscard
function cov.running() end

--- Arms line-hit collection on another thread (a coroutine), which
--- counts into the same process-global state. A coroutine created
--- while collection runs inherits the hook already; this opts in one
--- that existed before `start`.
---@param thread thread The coroutine to arm
function cov.arm(thread) end

--- Returns a fresh copy of the collected counts, keyed by chunk source
--- as reported by `debug.getinfo` (e.g. `"@o/main.lua"`), each value
--- mapping line number to hit count. Collection state is unchanged;
--- zero-hit chunks are never present.
---@return table<string, table<integer, integer>> hits Executed line counts by chunk source
---@nodiscard
function cov.snapshot() end

--- Discards all collected counts. Armed hooks stay armed and keep
--- counting into the now-empty state.
function cov.reset() end

--- The repl module provides programmatic access to the same interactive
--- read-eval-print-loop that the lua binary runs in interactive mode.
repl = {}

--- Starts an interactive read-eval-print-loop (REPL) on standard input
--- and output, with line editing, history, and tab completion. Each
--- input line is evaluated as an expression (printing its results) or
--- as a statement. The loop runs until end of input (Ctrl-D). Takes no
--- arguments and returns nothing.
function repl.start() end

--- The cosmo module is the top-level table returned by
--- `require("cosmo")` in the cosmopolitan lua binary. It exposes the
--- general-purpose functions that redbean historically provided as
--- globals: hashing, encoding, compression, URL and HTTP parsing, an
--- HTTP client, and various system introspection helpers. Submodules
--- (`cosmo.unix`, `cosmo.path`, `cosmo.re`, `cosmo.argon2`,
--- `cosmo.lsqlite3`, `cosmo.getopt`, `cosmo.zip`, `cosmo.cov`,
--- `cosmo.repl`) are registered in `package.loaded` and may be
--- required directly, e.g. `require("cosmo.unix")`.
cosmo = {}

--- Options for `Barf`: the mode a newly created file gets, and whether to
--- append or overwrite a slice instead of truncating.
---@class cosmo.BarfOptions
---@field mode integer? file mode for a newly created file, defaults to 0644
---@field append boolean? append to the file instead of truncating it (default false)
---@field offset integer? 1-indexed byte offset for overwriting a slice of the file; incompatible with `append`

--- Writes all data to file the easy way.
---
--- This function writes to the local file system. By default it truncates
--- (or creates) the file. Pass `append = true` to append instead, or an
--- `offset` to overwrite a slice in place. On failure it returns nil plus
--- an error string that names the path.
---
---@param filename string
---@param data string

function cosmo.DecodeHex(ascii) end

--- Turns JSON string into a Lua data structure.
---
--- This is a generally permissive parser, in the sense that like
--- v8, it permits scalars as top-level values. Therefore we must
--- note that this API can be thought of as special, in the sense
---
---     val = assert(DecodeJson(str))
---
--- will usually do the right thing, except in cases where `false`
--- or `null` are the top-level value. In those cases, it's needed
--- to check the second value too in order to discern from error
---
---     val, err = DecodeJson(str)
---     if not val then
---        if err then
---           print('bad json', err)
---        elseif val == nil then
---           print('val is null')
---        elseif val == false then
---           print('val is false')
---        end
---     end
---
--- This parser supports 64-bit signed integers. If an overflow
--- happens, then the integer is silently coerced to double, as
--- consistent with v8. If a double overflows, it decodes as
--- `Infinity`, which `EncodeJson` refuses to re-encode unless
--- `nan="null"` is given; underflows, like v8, are coerced to `0.0`.
---
--- When objects are parsed, your Lua object can't preserve the
--- original ordering of fields. As such, they'll be sorted by
--- `EncodeJson()` and may not round-trip with original intent.
---
--- Decoded arrays are marked with a shared `json.array` metatable so
--- that an empty `[]` won't round-trip as `{}`. The marker carries no
--- data: `next()` on a decoded `[]` returns nil, and `pairs()` sees
--- only the array elements. Use `jsonarray()` to mark tables you build
--- yourself.
---
--- This parser has perfect conformance with JSONTestSuite.
---
--- This parser validates utf-8 and utf-16.
---
--- The `options` table takes one field: `nullval`, a caller-supplied
--- value that stands in for JSON `null` (dkjson-style), so nulls
--- survive the decode as a distinguishable value — `cosmo.null`
--- re-encodes as `null`, making null round-trips lossless. Without it,
--- `null` decodes to nil: null-valued object keys vanish and arrays
--- containing null decode with holes (which `EncodeJson` then refuses
--- as sparse unless `sparsenull=true` is given).

--- Reads the table a Lua literal file returns, without running it.

--- are refused, so reading a file cannot run one.

--- Values equal what executing the same source would return: escapes

---
--- On failure the second result describes the refusal and the third is

--- Turns Lua data structure into JSON string.
---
--- Since Lua uses tables are both hashmaps and arrays, we use a
--- simple fast algorithm for telling the two apart. Tables with
--- non-zero length (as reported by `#`) are encoded as arrays,
--- and any non-array elements are ignored. For example:
---
---     >: EncodeJson({2})
---     "[2]"
---     >: EncodeJson({[1]=2, ["hi"]=1})
---     "[2]"
---
--- An array with holes is an error by default: a hole would otherwise
--- have to either truncate the array (silent data loss) or invent a
--- value. Passing `sparsenull=true` encodes each hole as `null`
--- instead, which is how an array containing JSON `null` round-trips
--- losslessly:
---
---     >: EncodeJson({[1]=1, [3]=3})
---     nil     "sparse array (pass sparsenull=true to encode holes as null)"
---     >: EncodeJson({[1]=1, [3]=3}, {sparsenull=true})
---     "[1,null,3]"
---
--- If the raw length of a table is reported as zero, then we check
--- whether it carries the shared `json.array` marker metatable. If it
--- does, your table will be serialized as empty array `[]`. The marker
--- is applied by `DecodeJson()` to every decoded array, so empty arrays
--- round-trip; use `jsonarray()` to mark empty tables you build
--- yourself. If raw length is zero and the marker is absent, then your
--- table will be serialized as an iterated object.
---
---     >: EncodeJson({})
---     "{}"
---     >: EncodeJson(jsonarray({}))
---     "[]"
---     >: EncodeJson({["hi"]=1})
---     "{\"hi\":1}"
---     >: EncodeJson({["hi"]=1, [7]=false})
---     nil     "json objects must only use string keys"
---
--- A table carrying the `json.null` sentinel metatable (see the
--- `null` value on this module) is serialized as `null`, which makes
--- lossless `{"a":null}` round-trips possible.
---
--- The following options may be used:
---
--- - `useoutput`: `(bool=false)` encodes the result directly to the output buffer
---   and returns nil value. This option is ignored if used outside of request
---   handling code.
--- - `sorted`: `(bool=true)` Lua uses hash tables so the order of object keys is
---   lost in a Lua table. So, by default, we use strcmp to impose a deterministic
---   output order. If you don't care about ordering then setting `sorted=false`
---   should yield a performance boost in serialization.
--- - `pretty`: `(bool=false)` Setting this option to true will cause tables with
---   more than one entry to be formatted across multiple lines for readability.
--- - `indent`: `(str=" ")` This option controls the indentation of pretty
---    formatting. This field is ignored if pretty isn't `true`.
--- - `maxdepth`: `(int=64)` This option controls the maximum amount of recursion
---   the serializer is allowed to perform. The max is 32767. You might not be able
---   to set it that high if there isn't enough C stack memory. Your serializer
---   checks for this and will return an error rather than crashing.
--- - `nan`: `(str)` The only accepted value is `"null"`, which makes NaN
---   and Infinity serialize as `null` (the v8 behavior) instead of
---   failing the encode.
--- - `sparsenull`: `(bool=false)` encode array holes as `null` instead
---   of failing the encode. Bounded: an array whose largest index
---   exceeds 8x its element count (beyond a 64-element floor) still
---   fails, so one stray huge index cannot make the encode unbounded.
---
--- This function will return an error if:
---
--- - value is cyclic
--- - value has depth greater than 64
--- - value contains functions, user data, or threads
--- - value is table that blends string / non-string keys
--- - value contains NaN or Infinity and `nan="null"` wasn't given
--- - value is an array with holes and `sparsenull` wasn't given
--- - Your serializer runs out of C heap memory (setrlimit)
---
--- A float always encodes carrying a `.` or an exponent, even when its value
--- is integral (`EncodeJson(0.0)` is `"0.0"`), so numbers round-trip through
--- `DecodeJson` by value AND by Lua number type. Integers are unaffected.
---
--- We assume strings in value contain UTF-8. This serializer currently does not
--- produce UTF-8 output. The output format is right now ASCII. Your UTF-8 data
--- will be safely transcoded to `\uXXXX` sequences which are UTF-16. Overlong
--- encodings in your input strings will be canonicalized rather than validated.

--- Turns Lua data structure into Lua code string.

--- 1. for all 𝑘=𝑣 in table, 𝑘 is an integer ≥1
--- 2. no holes exist between MIN(𝑘) and MAX(𝑘)
--- 3. if non-empty, MIN(𝑘) is 1

---   checks for this and will return an error rather than crashing.
--- - `literal`: `(bool=false)` Fail with `nil, reason` on any value outside the
---   literal-data domain, rather than spelling it as something a literal reader
---   turns down. This turns every accommodation described below into a refusal:
---   the `"kind@pointer"` placeholder for threads, functions and userdata, the
---   same placeholder for a cyclic table and for nesting past `maxdepth`, the
---   arithmetic `math.mininteger` and the non-finite numbers are written as, and
---   the `\e` escape for byte 27. A non-string or reserved-word table key is
---   refused too — the latter is spelled bare, which does not parse. Use this
---   when the output has to be read back as data rather than looked at.
---
--- If a user data object has a `__repr` or `__tostring` meta method, then that'll
--- be used to encode the Lua code.
---
--- This serializer is designed primarily to describe data. For example, it's used
--- by the REPL where we need to be able to ignore errors when displaying data
--- structures, since showing most things imperfectly is better than crashing.
--- Therefore this isn't the kind of serializer you'd want to use to persist data
--- in prod. Try using the JSON serializer for that purpose.
---
--- Non-encodable value types (e.g. threads, functions) will be represented as a
--- string literal with the type name and pointer address. The string description
--- is of an unspecified format that could most likely change. This encoder detects
--- cyclic tables; however instead of failing, it embeds a string of unspecified
--- layout describing the cycle.
---
--- Integer literals are encoded as decimal. However if the int64 number is ≥256
--- and has a population count of 1 then we switch to representating the number in
--- hexadecimal, for readability. Hex numbers have leading zeroes added in order
--- to visualize whether the number fits in a uint16, uint32, or int64. Also some
--- numbers can only be encoded expressionally. For example, `NaN`s are serialized
--- as `0/0`, and `Infinity` is `math.huge`.

--- - `body` (default: `""`): sets the body value to be sent.
--- - `followredirect` (default: `true`): forces temporary and permanent redirects
---    to be followed. This behavior can be disabled by passing `false`.
--- - `maxredirects` (default: `5`): sets the number of allowed redirects to
---   minimize looping due to misconfigured servers. When the number is exceeded,
---   the result of the last redirect is returned.
--- - `keepalive` (default = `false`): configures each request to keep the
---   connection open (unless closed by the server) and reuse for the
---   next request to the same host. This option is disabled when SSL
---   connection is used.
---   When a table is passed, it is used as the socket pool: the mapping
---   of hosts to their sockets is stored in it, so the same table can be
---   passed to the next call. If that table includes the `close` field
---   set to a true value, then the connection is closed after the
---   request is made and the host is removed from the mapping table.
---   When `true` is passed, a process-wide internal pool is used
---   instead; the options table is never modified.
--- - `allowprivate` (default: `false`): allow requests to private,
---   loopback, and other non-public network addresses, which are
---   otherwise blocked to prevent SSRF. The opt-out covers every hop of
---   a redirect chain.
--- - `proxy` (string): HTTP proxy URL, e.g. `"http://proxy:8080"`.
---   Supports Basic authentication: `"http://user:pass@proxy:8080"`.
--- - `maxresponse` (default: `104857600`): maximum response size in bytes.
---   Protects against memory exhaustion from large responses.  Must be >= 0;
---   negative values are rejected.
--- - `timeout` (number, seconds): per-operation socket timeout (read/write/
---   connect).  A value of `0` or absent keeps the 60-second default.  There
---   is no "infinite" option — use a large positive value if needed.  The
---   timeout also bounds the TLS handshake.
---
--- Environment variables:
---
--- - `http_proxy` / `HTTP_PROXY`: default proxy URL when `proxy` option

--- - `SSL_CERT_FILE`: path to CA certificate bundle file for TLS verification.

--- - `pass` is the password string, or nil if absent
--- - `host` is the hostname string, or nil if `url` was a path
--- - `port` is the port string, or nil if absent

--- - `kUrlPlus` to turn `+` into space
--- - `kUrlLatin1` to transcode ISO-8859-1 input into UTF-8
---
--- This parser is charset agnostic. Percent encoded bytes are
--- decoded for all fields. Returned values might contain things
--- like NUL characters, spaces, control codes, and non-canonical
--- encodings. Absent can be discerned from empty by checking if
--- the pointer is set.
---
--- There's no failure condition for this routine. This is a
--- permissive parser. This doesn't normalize path segments like
--- `.` or `..` so use IsAcceptablePath() to check for those. No
--- restrictions are imposed beyond that which is strictly
--- necessary for parsing. All the data that is provided will be
--- consumed to the one of the fields. Strict conformance is

--- it's the most non-deterministically defined field of them all.
---
--- Please note this is a URL parser, not a URI parser. Which
--- means we support everything the URI spec says we should do
--- except for the things we won't do, like tokenizing path
--- segments into an array and then nesting another array beneath
--- each of those for storing semicolon parameters. So this parser
--- won't make SIP easy. What it can do is parse HTTP URLs and most

--- Gets IP address associated with hostname.
---
--- This function first checks if hostname is already an IP address, in which case
--- it returns the result of `ParseIp`. Otherwise, it checks HOSTS.TXT on the local
--- system and returns the first IPv4 address associated with hostname. If no such
--- entry is found, a DNS lookup is performed using the system configured (e.g.
--- `/etc/resolv.conf`) DNS resolution service. If the service returns multiple IN
--- A records then only the first one is returned.
---
--- The returned address is word-encoded in host endian order. For example,
--- 1.2.3.4 is encoded as 0x01020304. The `FormatIp` function may be used to turn
--- this value back into a string.
---
--- If no IP address could be found, then `nil` is returned alongside a string of
--- unspecified format describing the error. Calls to this function may be wrapped
--- in `assert()` if an exception is desired.
---
--- When `timeout_ms` is given and non-negative, the DNS lookup is bounded:
--- past the deadline `nil` is returned with a "DNS lookup timed out" error
--- instead of blocking for the resolver's full internal budget. The lookup
--- runs on a disowned worker thread past the deadline, so a slow resolver
--- costs a bounded background thread, never the caller's time. Literal IP
--- inputs parse immediately and never wait. Omit `timeout_ms` (or pass a
--- negative value) for the unbounded blocking behavior.

---     assert(assert(Slurp('x.txt', 2, 3)) == 'bc')

--- Opens file.
---
--- Returns a file descriptor integer that needs to be closed, e.g.
---
---     fd = assert(unix.open("/etc/passwd", unix.O_RDONLY))
---     print(unix.read(fd))
---     unix.close(fd)
---
--- `flags` should have one of:
---
--- - `O_RDONLY`:     open for reading (default)
--- - `O_WRONLY`:     open for writing
--- - `O_RDWR`:       open for reading and writing
---
--- The following values may also be OR'd into `flags`:
---
---  - `O_CREAT`      create file if it doesn't exist
---  - `O_TRUNC`      automatic ftruncate(fd,0) if exists
---  - `O_CLOEXEC`    automatic close() upon execve()
---  - `O_EXCL`       exclusive access (see below)
---  - `O_APPEND`     open file for append only
---  - `O_NONBLOCK`   asks read/write to fail with EAGAIN rather than block
---  - `O_DIRECTORY`  useful for stat'ing (hint on UNIX but required on NT)
---  - `O_NOFOLLOW`   fail if it's a symlink (zero on Windows)
---  - `O_UNLINK`     automatically delete file upon close()
---  - `O_SYNC`       makes file operations synchronize appropriately
---  - `O_RSYNC`      synchronize read() operations
---  - `O_DSYNC`      synchronize write() operations
---  - `O_DIRECT`     it's complicated (not supported on Apple and OpenBSD)
---  - `O_NOATIME`    don't record access time (zero on non-Linux)
---
---  There are three regular combinations for the above flags:
---
---  - `O_RDONLY`: Opens existing file for reading. If it doesn't exist
---    then nil is returned and errno will be `ENOENT` (or in some other
---    cases `ENOTDIR`).
---
---  - `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`: Creates file. If it already exists,
---    then the existing copy is destroyed and the opened file will
---    start off with a length of zero. This is the behavior of the
---    traditional creat() system call.
---
---  - `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL`: Create file only if doesn't exist
---    already. If it does exist then `nil` is returned along with
---    `errno` set to `EEXIST`.
---
--- `dirfd` defaults to to `unix.AT_FDCWD` and may optionally be set to
--- a directory file descriptor to which `path` is relative.
---
--- Returns `ENOENT` if `path` doesn't exist.
---
--- Returns `ENOTDIR` if `path` contained a directory component that
--- wasn't a directory
---.

--- Closes file descriptor.
---
--- This function should never be called twice for the same file
--- descriptor, regardless of whether or not an error happened. The file
--- descriptor is always gone after close is called. So it technically
--- always succeeds, but that doesn't mean an error should be ignored.
--- For example, on NFS a close failure could indicate data loss.
---
--- Closing does not mean that scheduled i/o operations have been
--- completed. You'd need to use fsync() or fdatasync() beforehand to
--- ensure that. You shouldn't need to do that normally, because our
--- close implementation guarantees a consistent view, since on systems
--- where it isn't guaranteed (like Windows) close will implicitly sync.
---
--- File descriptors are automatically closed on exit().
---
--- Returns `EBADF` if `fd` wasn't valid.
---
--- Returns `EINTR` possibly maybe.

--- Invokes `_Exit(exitcode)` on the process. This will immediately

--- will be closed. Any open connections it owns will be reset. This
--- function never returns.
---@param exitcode integer?
function unix.exit(exitcode) end

--- Returns raw environment variables.
---
--- This allocates and constructs the C/C++ `environ` variable as a Lua
--- table consisting of string keys and string values.
---
--- This data structure preserves casing. On Windows NT, by convention,
--- environment variable keys are treated in a case-insensitive way. It
--- is the responsibility of the caller to consider this.
---
--- This data structure preserves valueless variables. It's possible on
--- both UNIX and Windows to have an environment variable without an
--- equals, even though it's unusual.
---
--- This data structure preserves duplicates. For example, on Windows,
--- there's some irregular uses of environment variables such as how the
--- command prompt inserts multiple environment variables with empty
--- string as keys, for its internal bookkeeping.
---
---@return string[] environ list of `"KEY=value"` strings

---@return true|nil

--- Clears all environment variables.
---
--- This wraps the C `clearenv()` function to allow Lua scripts to
--- remove all environment variables at once. Never fails: this
--- project's `clearenv()` (`libc/intrin/clearenv.c`)
--- unconditionally sets `environ = 0` and returns success.
---@return true

--- Gets login name of current user.

function unix.getlogin() end

--- Creates a new process mitosis style.
---
--- This system call returns twice. The parent process gets the nonzero
--- pid. The child gets zero.
---
--- Here's a simple usage example of creating subprocesses, where we
--- fork off a child worker from a main process hook callback to do some
--- independent chores, such as sending an HTTP request back to redbean.
---
---    -- as soon as server starts, make a fetch to the server
---    -- then signal redbean to shutdown when fetch is complete
---    local onServerStart = function()
---       if assert(unix.fork()) == 0 then
---          local ok, headers, body = Fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/test')
---          unix.kill(unix.getppid(), unix.SIGTERM)
---          unix.exit(0)
---       end
---    end
---    OnServerStart = onServerStart
---
--- We didn't need to use `wait()` here, because (a) we want redbean to go
--- back to what it was doing before as the `Fetch()` completes, and (b)
--- redbean's main process already has a zombie collector. However it's
--- a moot point, since once the fetch is done, the child process then
--- asks redbean to gracefully shutdown by sending SIGTERM its parent.
---
--- This is actually a situation where we *must* use fork, because the
--- purpose of the main redbean process is to call accept() and create
--- workers. So if we programmed redbean to use the main process to send
--- a blocking request to itself instead, then redbean would deadlock
--- and never be able to accept() the client.
---
--- While deadlocking is an extreme example, the truth is that latency
--- issues can crop up for the same reason that just cause jitter
--- instead, and as such, can easily go unnoticed. For example, if you
--- do soemething that takes longer than a few milliseconds from inside
--- your redbean heartbeat, then that's a few milliseconds in which
--- redbean is no longer concurrent, and tail latency is being added to
--- its ability to accept new connections. fork() does a great job at
--- solving this.
---
--- If you're not sure how long something will take, then when in doubt,
--- fork off a process. You can then report its completion to something
--- like SQLite. Redbean makes having lots of processes cheap. On Linux
--- they're about as lightweight as what heavyweight environments call
--- greenlets. You can easily have 10,000 Redbean workers on one PC.
---
--- Here's some benchmarks for fork() performance across platforms:
---
---    Linux 5.4 fork      l:     97,200𝑐    31,395𝑛𝑠  [metal]
---    FreeBSD 12 fork     l:    236,089𝑐    78,841𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
---    Darwin 20.6 fork    l:    295,325𝑐    81,738𝑛𝑠  [metal]
---    NetBSD 9 fork       l:  5,832,027𝑐 1,947,899𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
---    OpenBSD 6.8 fork    l: 13,241,940𝑐 4,422,103𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
---    Windows10 fork      l: 18,802,239𝑐 6,360,271𝑛𝑠  [metal]
---
--- One of the benefits of using `fork()` is it creates an isolation
--- barrier between the different parts of your app. This can lead to
--- enhanced reliability and security. For example, redbean uses fork so
--- it can wipe your ssl keys from memory before handing over control to
--- request handlers that process untrusted input. It also ensures that
--- if your Lua app crashes, it won't take down the server as a whole.
--- Hence it should come as no surprise that `fork()` would go slower on
--- operating systems that have more security features. So depending on
--- your use case, you can choose the operating system that suits you.

---   Acquires lock on file interval.
---
---   POSIX Advisory Locks allow multiple processes to leave voluntary
---   hints to each other about which portions of a file they're using.
---
---   The command may be:
---
---   - `F_SETLK` to acquire lock if possible
---   - `F_SETLKW` to wait for lock if necessary
---
---   `fd` is file descriptor of open() file.
---
---   `type` may be one of:
---
---   - `F_RDLCK` for read lock (default)
---   - `F_WRLCK` for read/write lock
---   - `F_UNLCK` to unlock
---
---   `start` is 0-indexed byte offset into file. The default is zero.
---
---   `len` is byte length of interval. Zero is the default and it means
---   until the end of the file.
---
---   `whence` may be one of:
---
---   - `SEEK_SET` start from beginning (default)
---   - `SEEK_CUR` start from current position
---   - `SEEK_END` start from end
---
---   Returns `EAGAIN` if lock couldn't be acquired. POSIX says this
---   theoretically could also be `EACCES` but we haven't seen this
---   behavior on any of our supported platforms.

---
--- `clock` can be any one of of:
---
--- - `CLOCK_REALTIME` returns a wall clock timestamp represented in
---   nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch (~1970). It'll count time in the
---   suspend state. This clock is subject to being smeared by various
---   adjustments made by NTP. These timestamps can have unpredictable
---   discontinuous jumps when clock_settime() is used. Therefore this
---   clock is the default clock for everything, even pthread condition
---   variables. Cosmopoiltan guarantees this clock will never raise
---   `EINVAL` and also guarantees `CLOCK_REALTIME == 0` will always be
---   the case. On Windows this maps to GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime().
---   On platforms with vDSOs like Linux, Windows, and MacOS ARM64 this
---   should take about 20 nanoseconds.
---
--- - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` returns a timestamp with an unspecified epoch,
---   that should be when the system was powered on. These timestamps
---   shouldn't go backwards. Timestamps shouldn't count time spent in
---   the sleep, suspend, and hibernation states. These timestamps won't
---   be impacted by clock_settime(). These timestamps may be impacted by
---   frequency adjustments made by NTP. Cosmopoiltan guarantees this
---   clock will never raise `EINVAL`. MacOS and BSDs use the word
---   "uptime" to describe this clock. On Windows this maps to
---   QueryUnbiasedInterruptTimePrecise().
---
--- - `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` is a monotonic clock returning a timestamp with an
---   unspecified epoch, that should be relative to when the host system
---   was powered on. These timestamps shouldn't go backwards. Timestamps
---   should also include time spent in a sleep, suspend, or hibernation
---   state. These timestamps aren't impacted by clock_settime(), but
---   they may be impacted by frequency adjustments made by NTP. This
---   clock will raise an `EINVAL` error on extremely old Linux distros
---   like RHEL5. MacOS and BSDs use the word "monotonic" to describe
---   this clock. On Windows this maps to QueryInterruptTimePrecise().
---
--- - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` returns a timestamp from an unspecified
---   epoch. These timestamps don't count time spent in the sleep,
---   suspend, and hibernation states. Unlike `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` this
---   clock is guaranteed to not be impacted by frequency adjustments or
---   discontinuous jumps caused by clock_settime(). Providing this level
---   of assurances may make this clock slower than the normal monotonic
---   clock. Furthermore this clock may cause `EINVAL` to be raised if
---   running on a host system that doesn't provide those guarantees,
---   e.g. OpenBSD and MacOS on AMD64.
---
--- - `CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE` is the same as `CLOCK_REALTIME` except
---   it'll go faster if the host OS provides a cheaper way to read the
---   wall time. Please be warned that coarse can be really coarse.
---   Rather than nano precision, you're looking at `CLK_TCK` precision,
---   which can lag as far as 30 milliseconds behind or possibly more.
---   Cosmopolitan may fallback to `CLOCK_REALTIME` if a faster less
---   accurate clock isn't provided by the system. This clock will raise
---   an `EINVAL` error on extremely old Linux distros like RHEL5.
---
--- - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE` is the same as `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` except
---   it'll go faster if the host OS provides a cheaper way to read the
---   unbiased time. Please be warned that coarse can be really coarse.
---   Rather than nano precision, you're looking at `CLK_TCK` precision,
---   which can lag as far as 30 milliseconds behind or possibly more.
---   Cosmopolitan may fallback to `CLOCK_REALTIME` if a faster less
---   accurate clock isn't provided by the system. This clock will raise
---   an `EINVAL` error on extremely old Linux distros like RHEL5.
---
--- - `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID` returns the amount of time this process
---   was actively scheduled. This is similar to getrusage() and clock().
---   Cosmopoiltan guarantees this clock will never raise `EINVAL`.
---
--- - `CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` returns the amount of time this thread
---   was actively scheduled. This is similar to getrusage() and clock().
---   Cosmopoiltan guarantees this clock will never raise `EINVAL`.
---
--- An invalid clock id, or one this platform cannot serve (the `_COARSE`
--- clocks on extremely old Linux distros), raises a bad-argument error —
--- wrap the call in `pcall` to feature-probe a nonstandard clock. The
--- per-clock guarantees above name the clocks that can never fail.

---@param handler? function|integer can be:
---
--- - Lua function
--- - `unix.SIG_IGN`
--- - `unix.SIG_DFL`
---
---@param flags? integer can have:
---
--- - `unix.SA_RESTART`: Enables BSD signal handling semantics. Normally
--- i/o entrypoints check for pending signals to deliver. If one gets
--- delivered during an i/o call, the normal behavior is to cancel the
--- i/o operation and return -1 with `EINTR` in errno. If you use the
--- `SA_RESTART` flag then that behavior changes, so that any function
--- that's been annotated with @restartable will not return `EINTR`
--- and will instead resume the i/o operation. This makes coding
--- easier but it can be an anti-pattern if not used carefully, since
--- poor usage can easily result in latency issues. It also requires
--- one to do more work in signal handlers, so special care needs to
--- be given to which C library functions are @asyncsignalsafe.
---
--- - `unix.SA_RESETHAND`: Causes signal handler to be single-shot. This
--- means that, upon entry of delivery to a signal handler, it's reset
--- to the `SIG_DFL` handler automatically. You may use the alias
--- `SA_ONESHOT` for this flag, which means the same thing.
---
--- - `unix.SA_NODEFER`: Disables the reentrancy safety check on your signal
--- handler. Normally that's a good thing, since for instance if your
--- `SIGSEGV` signal handler happens to segfault, you're going to want
--- your process to just crash rather than looping endlessly. But in
--- some cases it's desirable to use `SA_NODEFER` instead, such as at
--- times when you wish to `longjmp()` out of your signal handler and
--- back into your program. This is only safe to do across platforms
--- for non-crashing signals such as `SIGCHLD` and `SIGINT`. Crash
--- handlers should use Xed instead to recover execution, because on
--- Windows a `SIGSEGV` or `SIGTRAP` crash handler might happen on a
--- separate stack and/or a separate thread. You may use the alias
--- `SA_NOMASK` for this flag, which means the same thing.
---
--- - `unix.SA_NOCLDWAIT`: Changes `SIGCHLD` so the zombie is gone and
--- you can't call wait() anymore; similar but may still deliver the
--- SIGCHLD.
---
--- - `unix.SA_NOCLDSTOP`: Lets you set `SIGCHLD` handler that's only
--- notified on exit/termination and not notified on `SIGSTOP`,
--- `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN`, `SIGTTOU`, or `SIGCONT`.
---
--- Example:
---
---     function OnSigUsr1(sig)
---         gotsigusr1 = true
---     end
---     gotsigusr1 = false
---     oldmask = assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_BLOCK, unix.sigset(unix.SIGUSR1)))
---     assert(unix.sigaction(unix.SIGUSR1, OnSigUsr1))
---     assert(unix.raise(unix.SIGUSR1))
---     assert(not gotsigusr1)
---     ok, err, errno = unix.sigsuspend(oldmask)
---     assert(not ok)
---     assert(errno == unix.EINTR)
---     assert(gotsigusr1)
---     assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_SETMASK, oldmask))
---
--- When `handler` is a Lua function, it is dispatched *deferred* rather than
--- from the raw signal context: the real signal handler only records the
--- signal and the Lua function is then invoked at the next Lua VM instruction
--- boundary, in normal execution context. This is required because the Lua VM
--- is not async-signal-safe -- running Lua from a true signal handler that
--- interrupted the VM mid-allocation or mid-GC can corrupt the heap. A
--- consequence is that a blocking syscall interrupted by the signal still
--- returns `EINTR` immediately (so `sigsuspend`/poll wakeups are preserved),
--- but the Lua handler body runs a moment later once the VM resumes. Integer
--- handlers (e.g. `unix.SIG_IGN`, `unix.SIG_DFL`, or a raw function pointer)
--- are installed directly and are not deferred.
---
--- It's a good idea to not do too much work in a signal handler.

--- when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows
--- where it should be possible to poll getrusage() with setitimer().
---
--- - `RLIMIT_FSIZE` causes `SIGXFSZ` to sent to the process when the

--- Restrict system operations.
---
--- This can be used to sandbox your redbean workers. It allows finer
--- customization compared to the `-S` flag.
---
--- Pledging causes most system calls to become unavailable. On Linux the
--- disabled calls will return EPERM whereas OpenBSD kills the process.
---
--- Using pledge is irreversible. On Linux it causes PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS
--- to be set on your process.
---
--- By default exit and exit_group are always allowed. This is useful
--- for processes that perform pure computation and interface with the
--- parent via shared memory.
---
--- Once pledge is in effect, the chmod functions (if allowed) will not
--- permit the sticky/setuid/setgid bits to change. Linux will EPERM here
--- and OpenBSD should ignore those three bits rather than crashing.
---
--- User and group IDs also can't be changed once pledge is in effect.
--- OpenBSD should ignore the chown functions without crashing. Linux
--- will just EPERM.
---
--- Memory functions won't permit creating executable code after pledge.
--- Restrictions on origin of SYSCALL instructions will become enforced
--- on Linux (cf. msyscall) after pledge too, which means the process
--- gets killed if SYSCALL is used outside the .privileged section. One
--- exception is if the "exec" group is specified, in which case these
--- restrictions need to be loosened.

---
--- ### stdio

--- fcntl(F_SETFL).
---
--- ### rpath
---
--- Allows chdir, getcwd, open, stat, fstat, access, readlink, chmod,
--- chmod, fchmod.
---
--- ### wpath
---
--- Allows getcwd, open, stat, fstat, access, readlink, chmod, fchmod.
---
--- ### cpath
---
--- Allows rename, link, symlink, unlink, mkdir, rmdir.
---
--- ### fattr
---
--- Allows chmod, fchmod, utimensat, futimens.
---
--- ### flock

---
--- ### inet
---
--- Allows socket (AF_INET), listen, bind, connect, accept,
--- getpeername, getsockname, setsockopt, getsockopt, plus the
--- read-only interface ioctls used by siocgifconf() and
--- siocgifflags() (SIOCGIFCONF, SIOCGIFFLAGS, SIOCGIFNETMASK) on
--- Linux.
---
--- ### unix
---
--- Allows socket (AF_UNIX), listen, bind, connect, accept,

---
--- ### settime
---
--- Allows settimeofday and clock_adjtime.
---
--- ### unveil
---
--- Allows unveil().
---
--- ### exec
---
--- Allows execve, and on Linux memfd_create, which is needed to spawn
--- programs embedded in the zip filesystem (e.g.
--- `unix.execve("/zip/foo.com", ...)`).
---
--- If the executable in question needs a loader, then you will need
--- "rpath prot_exec" too. With APE, security is strongest when you
--- assimilate your binaries beforehand, using the --assimilate flag,
--- or the o//tool/build/assimilate program. On OpenBSD this is
--- mandatory.
---
--- ### prot_exec
---
--- Allows mmap(PROT_EXEC) and mprotect(PROT_EXEC).
---
--- This may be needed to launch non-static non-native executables,
--- such as non-assimilated APE binaries, or programs that link
--- dynamic shared objects, i.e. most Linux distro binaries.
---
---@param execpromises? string only matters if "exec" is specified in `promises`.
--- In that case, this specifies the promises that'll apply once `execve()`
--- happens. If this is `NULL` then the default is used, which is
--- unrestricted. OpenBSD allows child processes to escape the sandbox
--- (so a pledged OpenSSH server process can do things like spawn a root
--- shell). Linux however requires monotonically decreasing privileges.
--- This function will will perform some validation on Linux to make
--- sure that `execpromises` is a subset of `promises`. Your libc
--- wrapper for `execve()` will then apply its SECCOMP BPF filter later.
--- Since Linux has to do this before calling `sys_execve()`, the executed
--- process will be weakened to have execute permissions too.
---
---@param mode integer? if specified should specify one penalty:
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_KILL_THREAD` causes the violating thread to
---   be killed. This is the default on Linux. It's effectively the
---   same as killing the process, since redbean has no threads. The
---   termination signal can't be caught and will be either `SIGSYS`
---   or `SIGABRT`. Consider enabling stderr logging below so you'll
---   know why your program failed. Otherwise check the system log.
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_KILL_PROCESS` causes the process and all
---   its threads to be killed. This is always the case on OpenBSD.
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_RETURN_EPERM` causes system calls to just
---   return an `EPERM` error instead of killing. This is a gentler
---   solution that allows code to display a friendly warning. Please
---   note this may lead to weird behaviors if the software being
---   sandboxed is lazy about checking error results.
---
--- `mode` may optionally bitwise or the following flags:
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_STDERR_LOGGING` enables friendly error message
---   logging letting you know which promises are needed whenever
---   violations occur. Without this, violations will be logged to
---   `dmesg` on Linux if the penalty is to kill the process. You
---   would then need to manually look up the system call number and
---   then cross reference it with the cosmopolitan libc pledge()
---   documentation. You can also use `strace -ff` which is easier.
---   This is ignored OpenBSD, which already has a good system log.
---   Turning on stderr logging (which uses SECCOMP trapping) also
---   means that the `unix.WTERMSIG()` on your killed processes will
---   always be `unix.SIGABRT` on both Linux and OpenBSD. Otherwise,
---   Linux prefers to raise `unix.SIGSYS`.
---@return true|nil
---@return string? error
---@return unix.Errno? errno
function unix.pledge(promises, execpromises, mode) end

--- Restricts filesystem operations, e.g.
---
---    unix.unveil(".", "r");     -- current dir + children visible
---    unix.unveil("/etc", "r");  -- make /etc readable too
---    unix.unveil(nil, nil);     -- commit and lock policy
---
--- Unveiling restricts a thread's view of the filesystem to a set of
--- allowed paths with specific privileges.
---
--- Once you start using unveil(), the entire file system is considered
--- hidden. You then specify, by repeatedly calling unveil(), which paths
--- should become unhidden. When you're finished, you call `unveil(nil,nil)`
--- which commits your policy, after which further use is forbidden, in
--- the current thread, as well as any threads or processes it spawns.
---
--- There are some differences between unveil() on Linux versus OpenBSD.
---
--- 1. Build your policy and lock it in one go. On OpenBSD, policies take
---  effect immediately and may evolve as you continue to call unveil()
---  but only in a more restrictive direction. On Linux, nothing will
---  happen until you call `unveil(nil,nil)` which commits and locks.
---
--- 2. Try not to overlap directory trees. On OpenBSD, if directory trees
---  overlap, then the most restrictive policy will be used for a given
---  file. On Linux overlapping may result in a less restrictive policy
---  and possibly even undefined behavior.
---
--- 3. OpenBSD and Linux disagree on error codes. On OpenBSD, accessing
---  paths outside of the allowed set raises ENOENT, and accessing ones
---  with incorrect permissions raises EACCES. On Linux, both these
---  cases raise EACCES.
---
--- 4. Unlike OpenBSD, Linux does nothing to conceal the existence of
---  paths. Even with an unveil() policy in place, it's still possible
---  to access the metadata of all files using functions like stat()
---  and open(O_PATH), provided you know the path. A sandboxed process
---  can always, for example, determine how many bytes of data are in
---  /etc/passwd, even if the file isn't readable. But it's still not
---  possible to use opendir() and go fishing for paths which weren't
---  previously known.
---
--- This system call is supported natively on OpenBSD and polyfilled on
--- Linux using the Landlock LSM[1].

--- Creates interprocess shared memory mapping.
---
--- This function allocates special memory that'll be inherited across
--- fork in a shared way. By default all memory in Redbean is "private"
--- memory that's only viewable and editable to the process that owns
--- it. When unix.fork() happens, memory is copied appropriately so
--- that changes to memory made in the child process, don't clobber
--- the memory at those same addresses in the parent process. If you
--- don't want that to happen, and you want the memory to be shared
--- similar to how it would be shared if you were using threads, then
--- you can use this function to achieve just that.
---
--- The memory object this function returns may be accessed using its
--- methods, which support atomics and futexes. It's very low-level.
--- For example, you can use it to implement scalable mutexes:
---
---     mem = unix.mapshared(8000 * 8)
---
---     LOCK = 0 -- pick an arbitrary word index for lock
---
---     -- From Futexes Are Tricky Version 1.1 § Mutex, Take 3;
---     -- Ulrich Drepper, Red Hat Incorporated, June 27, 2004.
---     function Lock()
---         local ok, old = mem:cmpxchg(LOCK, 0, 1)
---         if not ok then
---             if old == 1 then
---                 old = mem:xchg(LOCK, 2)
---             end
---             while old > 0 do
---                 mem:wait(LOCK, 2)
---                 old = mem:xchg(LOCK, 2)
---             end
---         end
---     end
---     function Unlock()
---         old = mem:add(LOCK, -1)
---         if old == 2 then
---             mem:store(LOCK, 0)
---             mem:wake(LOCK, 1)
---         end
---     end
---
--- It's possible to accomplish the same thing as unix.mapshared()
--- using files and unix.fcntl() advisory locks. However this goes
--- significantly faster. For example, that's what SQLite does and
--- we recommend using SQLite for IPC in redbean. But, if your app
--- has thousands of forked processes fighting for a file lock you
--- might need something lower level than file locks, to implement
--- things like throttling. Shared memory is a good way to do that
--- since there's nothing that's faster.
---
---@param size integer
--- The `size` parameter needs to be a multiple of 8. The returned
--- memory is zero initialized. When allocating shared memory, you
--- should try to get as much use out of it as possible, since the
--- overhead of allocating a single shared mapping is 500 words of
--- resident memory and 8000 words of virtual memory. It's because
--- the Cosmopolitan Libc mmap() granularity is 2**16.
---
--- This system call does not fail. An exception is instead thrown

--- Waits for word to have a different value.
---
--- This method asks the kernel to suspend the process until either the

--- calls `unix.Memory:wake()`.
---
--- The `expect` parameter is used only upon entry to synchronize the
--- transition to kernelspace. The kernel doesn't actually poll the
--- memory location. It uses `expect` to make sure the process doesn't
--- get added to the wait list unless it's sure that it needs to wait,
--- since the kernel can only control the ordering of wait / wake calls
--- across processes.
---
--- Futex words are 32-bit. Although words are stored as 64-bit integers,
--- wait / wake only ever inspect the low 32 bits, so `expect` must fit in
--- an int32 and the word you wait on must hold only int32 values. If the
--- word at `word_index` has any of its high 32 bits set when you call
--- wait, this method raises an error rather than silently comparing a
--- truncated value (e.g. a stored 2^32+1 must not masquerade as 1).
---
--- The default behavior is to wait until the heat death of the universe
--- if necessary. You may alternatively specify an absolute deadline. If
--- it's less than or equal to the value returned by clock_gettime, then
--- this routine is non-blocking. Otherwise we'll block at most until
--- the current time reaches the absolute deadline.
---
--- Futexes are currently supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. On other
--- platforms this method calls sched_yield() and will either (1) return
--- unix.EINTR if a deadline is specified, otherwise (2) 0 is returned.
--- This means futexes will *work* on Windows, Mac, and NetBSD but they
--- won't be scalable in terms of CPU usage when many processes wait on
--- one process that holds a lock for a long time. In the future we may
--- polyfill futexes in userspace for these platforms to improve things
--- for folks who've adopted this api. If lock scalability is something
--- you need on Windows and MacOS today, then consider fcntl() which is
--- well-supported on all supported platforms but requires using files.
